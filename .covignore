# Coverage ignore patterns
# Use this file to exclude files/directories from test coverage requirements
# 
# Examples:
# /internal/database/config.go    - Exclude specific file
# /cmd                           - Exclude entire directory  
# /internal/routes               - Exclude routes (if just configuration)
# **/migrations/**               - Exclude database migrations
# **/*_mock.go                   - Exclude mock files
# **/*_gen.go                    - Exclude generated files

# Currently excluded paths:
/cmd                           # Main application and dependency injection (configuration files)
/internal/database/config.go   # Database configuration only
/internal/database/connection.go # Database connection setup only
